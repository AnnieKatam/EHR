					<p>Medication lists come in many forms, but this chapter will only focus on three.</p>
					<p>We will give you a guided tour of the medication list from a clinical perspective, explaining the principles of design and human factors in plain language as we go. This chapter offers a series of illustrations of Medication Lists good and not so good, our inspirational examples, and a playground of interactive widgets for you to explore and imagine with. In some cases, we'll provide code you can inspect, plug in, play with, improve or remold, and adopt in your EHR product.</p>
					<p><strong>A simple list</strong> is made to be read quickly and scanned at a glance giving the reader, say a physician, a quick overview and what we call "situational awareness" of the patient. </p>
					<blockquote>"There are only two prescription medications for high blood pressure," or in another case, "We have twenty-four medications to keep in mind here.” </blockquote>
					<p>Good design can make this task easy; bad design can make it much harder.</p>
					<p><strong>An interactive list</strong> helps with a variety of tasks such as making treatment decisions or e-prescribing. The list allows for sorting and filtering, designed specifically for the user’s task at hand. It might even have connections to other data in the EHR such as diagnoses or lab or vital signs. This list has the most information among our three examples here because the additional columns, some of which can be hidden, and the ability to sort and filter make this list very flexible. </p>
					<p>Finally, to harness the power of information visualization we describe a <strong>medication timeline</strong>, which provides a chronological overview, permits zooming and filtering, then reveals details on demand. The overview provides context, perspective, and discovery ("Wow, all the meds were changed six months ago."). Zooming and filtering can offer answers to preliminary questions or hunches (“I wonder if the kidney function dropped because of the new Celebrex prescription.”). Drilling for details can give the exact dates or related facts that could influence the medical chain of events (“When did that happen exactly? Wait, they also had a dose increase in lisinopril at the same time. Two culprits.”).</p>
					<div class="sidebar">
						<p>A number of tasks inform the design of medication list views. The three views we explore (simple list, interactive list, and timeline) are well adapted to several of these tasks. Other tasks might require specialized views.</p>
						<h5>Provider tasks</h5>
						<ol>
							<li>Simple, quick scan of list (simple list, few details)</li>
							<li>Therapeutic management (more details to guide decisions, but not necessarily actions)</li>
							<li>Medication renewals (for when to renew and for making adjustments)</li>
							<li>Medication reconciliation (comparing two or more lists at transitions of care)
								<ol><li>Review of which meds are the same, similar or different across two or more lists</li></ol></li>
							<li>Reviewing time course (timeline view)
								<ol><li>Exploration of past history - (to see at a glance changes, trends, and comparisons over time)</li></ol></li>
							<li>Managing temporary changes
								<ol><li>Managing brief medication courses (steroid bursts or intermittent treatment such as chemotherapy)</li>
								<li>Making peri-procedural adjustments (adjustments & temporary meds needed around the time of surgery)</li></ol></li>
							<li>Recalling tried and failed courses (what was effective, what wasn’t, and why?)</li>
							<li>Assessing adherence (are refills on time? are doses taken as planned?)</li>
						</ol>
						<h5>Patient tasks</h5>
						<ol>
							<li>Sharing simple list with others (for wallet or purse)</li>
							<li>Restock the pill organizer (to show which pills go in which slot of those little weekly boxes)</li>
							<li>Remember daily doses (reminder for each daily dose, and “less than daily” doses too. Check them off when taken.)</li>
							<li>Remember pharmacy refills (for coordinating trips to the pharmacy, and asking the doctor for renewals)</li>
							<li>Update list at end of doctor visit (after all the changes, the final list as the patient leaves for home. The EHR or PHR should handle that automatically)</li>
						</ol>

						<h3><a href="../simple-list/simple-list.html" target="blank">The Simple List</a></h3>
					</div>
					<p>The simple list has the bare-bones basic information. It is easy to scan visually to see the name, strength, and dosing of the medication. Alphabetical order makes it easy to find a particular item in the list.</p>
					<p>You can probably intuitively see that one looks cleaner than the other. That simplicity makes it easier to see the drug names, which are more important for getting a quick overview. The list shown here would work well for a physician or a patient, given its use of plain language, and avoiding the Latin abbreviations like “b.i.d.” instead of “twice a day.”</p>
					<div class="example" class="fig-2-1">
						<div class="ex-title">
							<span class="ex-type">Figure 2.1</span>
							<span class="ex-caption">Simple Medication List Makeover </span>
						</div>
						<a class="fancybox" href="./assets/images/examples/medication-list/SimpleList.png"><img src="./assets/images/examples/medication-list/SimpleList.png" class="scale-with-grid" /></a>
					</div>
					<p>A patient uses this list for simple tasks. Primarily, they will use it as a reference to show the list to somebody else: at the office of another physician or dentist, to emergency room staff, or to their caregiver. If a patient wanted to fill up a weekly medication reminder box, some would benefit from a more detailed list than this, which illustrated the contents of each compartment, differentiating the time of day more clearly for each dose.</p>
					<p>A physician or nurse would expect this simple format in a progress note from a previous visit, in a dashboard overview, or in a visit summary from an outside EHR. It is a quick snapshot to be taken in at a glance. If the physician were doing a more complex task, like e-prescribing, then a more complex view would be better. </p>
					<h5>Here’s a common scenario: Going into the exam room</h5>
					<p>A general internist is about to go into the exam room to see a 70-year-old man with sixteen chronic diseases (diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, knee arthritis, depression, insomnia, etc.) who is taking seventeen medications. He notes that the patient’s blood pressure is about ten points too high. He plans to ask the patient if he has been taking any home blood pressures, and what those results are.</p>
					<p>In this scenario, the physician needs to have an overall awareness of the patient’s medications, chronic problems, latest vital signs, and pertinent lab just prior to starting the face-to-face visit.  (“Are they taking insulin? Are they on any high-risk drugs like warfarin?”). That way, the physician is able to give their full attention to the patient telling their story, and to avoid looking away [at the EHR to be reminded of the medications. We can call that big picture of getting the patient in mind – their past and current data, their story, and the emotional tone of the human encounter – “establishing context.”</p>
					<p>A single-page dashboard can display all that data. The physician just needs to see the name quickly. Avoid the temptation to add extraneous detail here. Concise lists are easier to read. The physician doesn’t need to see the quantity, number of refills, or the start dates in this task. If a brand name is used in the list, be sure to include the generic name as well. Dealing with Brand vs. generic names and with compound names can be a challenge (see the sidebar).</p>
					<div class="sidebar">
						<h5>Handling brand and generic names</h5>
						<p>This can get tricky. We’ll admit right now: there may not be one correct answer to the problem of whether to show the Brand Name, the generic name, or both names by default in the list. It depends on the context, and the people in the conversation. Somewhere in the EHR, there should be easy access to both the generic and the Brand Name. </p>
						<p>Here are a few considerations.</p>
						<p>Ideally, both names would be available on demand at just the right time. If it’s a printed list, then you might have to choose one method of display. Alternatively, display both generic and brand name -- for example “furosemide (Lasix) 20 mg”. For consistency, sort alphabetically by the generic name.</p>
						<p>
							The brand name is frequently preferred in conversation because the generic name may be difficult to remember or pronounce, even for for physicians. Say these three times fast:
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>adalimumab --- Humira</li>
								<li>ondansetron --- Zofran</li>
								<li>furosemide --- Lasix</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							Some medications have so many different confusing brand names available, many of which are NOT interchangeable, that the problem is compounded. Diltiazem is an example. It may be available as:
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>Cardizem</li>
								<li>Cardizem LA</li>
								<li>Cardizem CD</li>
								<li>Cartia XT</li>
								<li>Dilacor XR</li>
								<li>and it goes on and on...</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<!--addlink to HF ch-->
					</div>
					<p>We can make that easier to read by <strong>emphasizing</strong> the name of the drug and <span class="grey">de-emphasizing</span> everything else. The physician’s eyes need to notice the name and strength without needing to read a whole line of text. The instructions (take 1 tablet daily) are secondary pieces of information. One method of denoting that instructions are of secondary importance is to use gray text that is perceptibly different while still readable.</p>
					<p>Use just enough difference to make it immediately apparent. If the difference in type is too great, it can be visually jarring. If the difference is too subtle, then it won’t be perceived by the visual processing system of the human brain. The features that the visual system detects readily are called “‘preattentive attributes.”</p>
				</div>				
				<div class="example">
					<div class="one-half column">
						<h5>Too jarring</h5>
						<p>lisinopril 20 mg 1 tablet daily</p>
					</div>
					<div class="one-half column">
						<h5>Too subtle</h5>
						<p>lisinopril 20 mg 1 tablet daily</p>

						<div class="tip"></div>
						<div class="qt-content show">
							<h5>Preattentive Attributes</h5>
							<p>The little things people notice visually and understand quickly, so quickly that we have only noticed it at an unconscious level.</p>
							<p>Several of the factors discussed above all combine with some other functions of our brains that are in play that make us notice some visual features more quickly than others. Examples include color, size, shape, orientation, and motion. We call these things that stand out to us preattentive attributes.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sixteen columns">
					<p>Alphabetize the list. The human brain expects a list of text items to be alphabetical in order to find a particular name quickly in a long list. “Are they taking warfarin?” Just jump to the “w” section.</p>
					<p>Reduce Visual Noise. If a visual element doesn’t add data, or improve the perception or processing of information, then try leaving it out.  See <a href="#gal-2-1">Interactive Gallery 2.1</a></p>

						<h3><a href="../med-table2/med-table.html" target="blank">The Interactive List</a></h3>
					</div>
					<p>This list allows the user to sort, filter, and otherwise adjust to the task at hand. This particular view is the standard workhorse in an EHR, and may sometimes be the only view. The table is flexible and powerful to fit a variety of different user tasks, but that means it has complexity and may require more effort to learn and use.</p>
					<p><a href="#fig-2-2">Figure 2.2</a> shows a standard table view of the Interactive Medication List, sorted alphabetically by medication name by default. Other columns can be sorted to group the data to fulfill additional functions. Not every data element needs to be sorted.  For example, you would generally not sort on the “instructions."</p>

					<h5>Returning to the clinical scenario: BP too high</h5>
					<p>Upon entering the room, the doctor learns that the patient has been exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet. He is on a seventeen medications, tolerating them well, and taking them consistently. His BP is about 10 points too high today, and it has been high at home as well. The doctor wants to adjust the BP medications to achieve better control.</p>
					<p>The physician turns to the interactive medication list and sorts the medications by diagnosis. He can readily see that the patient is already on three medications for a blood pressure. With some effort, the physician determines that all three medications are at their maximum dose, so a new medication will need to be added. He thinks the next drug of choice in this situation would be lisinopril, but he wonders, "Why isn't the patient on lisinopril already?</p>
					<p>
						Here’s the mental task for the physician (see <a href="#fig-2-3">Figure 2.3</a>): 
						<ul class="disc">
							<li><p>review the medication list</p></li>
							<li><p>identify medications for treating high BP (antihypertensives)</p></li>
							<li><p>determine if each medication has already reached its maximum dose.</p>
								<ul class="disc"><li><p>if all the BP meds are at their maximum dose, then a new medication needs to be selected and added to the treatment plan</p></li>
								<li><p>if one or more of the medications is not at the maximum dose, then that medication dose could be increased (and it won’t cost a new co-pay, increase potential drug interactions, or increase the number of pills the patient has to take)</p></li></ul></li>
						</ul>
						Sometimes, that is a lot of mental work. You can make the job much easier.
					</p>
					<!--Fig 2-3 mental model-->

					</div>
					<p>You can reduce the risk of error (missing one in the list) and lighten the mental effort (cognitive load) quite a bit by smart design features.</p>
					<p>In order of complexity, here are some solutions:</p>
					<ul class="disc">
						<li><p>Allow sorting the medication list by associated diagnosis. This groups them together and makes for far less reading, searching, and and relying on humans’ limited working memory (which can only hold 3 to 4 items). There are potential barriers to this approach. This won’t work unless the physician or provider has selected the diagnosis (or diagnoses) for each medication. Here’s how it would work: When the physician prescribes a new medication, the system presents the current list of diagnoses or chronic problems so the physician can merely pick one or more from the list or add a new one. That is a task that physicians have not been required to do, but there was no payoff until now. That work only needs to be done once for each medication, and it prevents a lot of future unnecessary mental work. Although it is more work to make the diagnosis assignment, physicians are already doing that for lab and imaging orders. With this sort-by-diagnosis feature, you are making the physician’s time investment pay off.</p></li>

						<li><p>Make that same dose range information available at a glance by using an icon. See the “Dose Max” column in Figure DDD. No clicks. No reading. No math. (see Figure ZZ).

						<h3><a href="../timeline/timeline_v9.4.html" target="blank">The Timeline View</a></h3>
					</div>
					<p>Physicians are yearning for a timeline. They are working with people who have many complex, chronic conditions (diseases), and are managing many interventions such as medications, laboratory tests, occasional procedures, and many visits with multiple health care providers at home, offices, and hospitals. How is it possible to manage all this complex data? It takes a tremendous amount of mental effort (cognitive load). In order to understand the time course for even a single medication, it requires a lot of digging through progress notes and through medication list tables reviewing years worth of prescription renewals. Even worse, that effort may need to be duplicated to understand a second or third medication.</p>
					<h5>Here’s an example of a medication timeline. </h5>
					<p>A timeline offers a complete overview. At the top level, it conveys a few basic details – When does a medication start or stop? When does the dose change, and is it going up or down? Is that the maximum dose?</p>
					<p>There are just a few simple rules necessary to understand how it works. Each bar represents the history of a single medication (e.g. citalopram started at 10 mg, and progressively increased to 40 mg daily). The timescale can be adjusted. The color black represents the maximum dose of that particular medication. Shades of gray represent progressively lower doses (lighter means lower). At a glance, there is a wealth of information. It’s straightforward.</p>
					<!--Interactive 2-2 Annotated Timeline-->
					<div class="example">
						<div class="ex-title">

					</div>
					<p>Here are the cognitive science and interface usability features incorporated into the timeline view.
						<ul class="disc">
							<li><p>The high-level overview shows the time course for the complete list of medications in a single view. It’s very efficient. The user won’t need to keep different pieces of information in working memory or make written notes just to keep track of details scattered across several EHR views. Patterns emerge visually (from preattentive attributes like color, length, and proximity) that would be far more difficult to deduce from text or numerical data.</p></li>
							<li><p>Zooming in on an area of interest allows exploration of more detail (text explanations, dose details, and even adherence information if pharmacy refill data is available to the EHR) to confirm hunches or to develop new questions to pursue.</p></li>
							<li><p>Filtering may show only active medications, discontinued medications, or both to help answer other questions that arise during the inquiry (“Why was this medication stopped here, and a switch made to that alternative medication?”).</p></li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>The timeline view serves every conceivable user well: physician, nurse, patient and caregiver, pharmacist, mental health professional, health coach, and any medical specialist. It can accommodate long lists of medications. A dozen medications can be quite common. Twenty medications would not be surprising. Thirty medications, sadly, may not be rare. The timeline view handles the visual burden with ease. Let’s look at a gallery to demonstrate how.</p>

					<p>The timeline efficiently shows an entire medication history in a single view. The user can tell at a glance important details about the medication dose at any particular point in time, and allows comparison to other medication dose patterns simultaneously.</p>
					<p>It is a tool for data visualization, whose mantra is “overview first, then zoom and filter, then details-on-demand.</p>
					<h5>Returning to the clinical scenario: What happened before today?</h5>
					<p>The physician had determined that the blood pressure was too high, and an additional drug would be necessary. He wondered why lisinopril had not been chosen. So, turning to the timeline view, he toggles for “Active Medications” to “Active + Inactive Medications” view. He sees that lisinopril had been prescribed, but only for a few months. He wonders, “Why was it stopped?” Doing a search of the chart, he finds a phone note reporting that the patient had developed a persistent dry cough, which had resolved upon stopping the lisinopril. There was no other record of that adverse effect, so the physician added lisinopril to the allergy list with “cough” as an “adverse effect.”</p>
					<!--Figure 2-7 lisinopril stopped-->
					<div class="example" id="fig-2-7">
						<div class="ex-title">

					</div>
					<p>The physician now considers adding amlodipine to control high blood pressure, but wonders about the patient’s adherence to the existing medications. Zooming in on the timeline view, he finds that the patient was 3 weeks late on refilling Coreg, but was embarrassed to admit to it. He had just ordered a refill last night, and planned to pick it up from the pharmacy after the visit today. The relatively high copay for Coreg was a barrier to getting it. So, the physician discussed cheaper alternatives in the beta-blocker class, and together they selected metoprolol XL 200 mg daily.</p>

					<p>Let’s review of what we’ve learned in this chapter.
						<ol>
							<li><p>Consider the user and the task at hand. That consideration will help you decide what details and functionality are needed for a particular medication list view. </p></li>
							<li><p>Use preattentive attributes (like color, size, shape, alignment) to draw the user’s attention to the salient details. </p></li>
							<li><p>Design in monochrome first, then add color sparingly and meaningfully, where it can add information, and not distract the user.</p></li>
							<li><p>Remember that humans have very limited working memory (only 3 to 4 items), so put information directly in view where possible. Eliminate the need to remember details from one step to the next in a task sequence.</p></li>
							<li><p>Provide situational awareness by giving an overview of all the key details. The extent of situational awareness depends on the task context (attain broad, limited depth overview versus making complex clinical decisions with many dependencies).</p></li>
							<li><p>Reduce cognitive load. Don’t make the user do math when the application could. Don’t require repetitive reading. Don’t require recall when you could present the information directly.</p></li>
							<li><p>Remember the data visualization mantra: Overview first, then zoom and filter, then details-on-demand.</p></li>
